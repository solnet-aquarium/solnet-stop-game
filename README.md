# Solnet Stop Game #

-- `firebase database` not active at the moment. If you want to run the app, please get in touch with us. --

We made this game to teach kids and youths at the Week of Engineering in Wellington,NZ the good things about been a Software Engineer.

When we wrote this game we applied simple rules in the process, not taking care of the 3D or 2D aspect, those comes with time and experience, what we wanted to achieve was : Write a very simple an entertain game to the entire public with 100 lines of code.

Yes, Code, this is the language we use as engineers, we speak English but when talking to a computer and instruct to do what we want we call *[code](https://code.org/)*.

The word changed a lot, everything in our digital life is controlled by a software written by a engineer like us and maybe you. How about that?

There are heaps and heaps of initiatives to help people learn to code, why? Because it helps you take decisions with a logical thinking and this even if you don't agree helps you in the daily basis life events if Engineer is not something you pursue for.

I hope we can inspire you and start writing your software, use this game as a cornerstone and make a new career enjoyable and having fun.

To guide you modify this game with your own rules or new features we wrote this guide bellow that helps speed up the process.

## How to play ##

### Creative process ###

  When we tried to create this game we had the idea of write a very simple game with less than 100 lines of code.

### Learn ###

  We use javascript to write this game, but is not hard to learn, you can learn Javascript for free.
  You can start learn using [Microsoft Academy for absolute beginner](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/javascript-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-14194).

### Setup ###

  We use a [service](https://firebase.google.com/) online to host the game, this [service](https://firebase.google.com/) is provided by Google and easy to use, most of the challenges of hosting, configuring, saving the data into the cloud is solved by this service, and makes our life more easy. Thanks Google Engineers.

  You will need to create a firebase account:
- A Google Account, which means youraccount@gmail.com is valid
- After that just [watch this video](https://youtu.be/iosNuIdQoy8?list=PLl-K7zZEsYLmOF_07IayrTntevxtbUxDL) that helps you to understand how this service works.
- Install [Git](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn-git/)
- Install the [Node.js v6](https://nodejs.org) in your machine.
- Now open your terminal window e navigate to the directory like.

      ```
        //For windows
        cd c:/
        mkdir mycoolproject
        cd mycoolproject
        npm install -g firebase-tools

        // For mac or Linux
        cd ˜/
        mkdir mycoolproject
        cd mycoolproject
        npm install -g firebase-tools
      ```
- Now you're ready to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1D0_wFlXgo) recorded from Google Engineers.
- Good luck!

### Technical terminology used in this game ###

- *Programming language* - A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. The term programming means that you choose one language and are using it to write your software, you can write in Javascript, CSS, HTML, PHP, Java, Golang, Scala.
- *Code - (kōd)* A system of signals used to represent letters or numbers in transmitting messages. The instructions in a computer program. Instructions written by a programmer in a programming language are often called source code.
- *Javascript* - an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. The Facebook you access every day is built on this language.
- *Firebase* - is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014, our game runs on this platform.
- *Platform* - is a group of technologies that are used as a base upon which other applications, processes or technologies are developed. In personal computing, a platform is the basic hardware (computer) and software (operating system) on which software applications can be run.
- *NodeJS* - is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- *Git* - is a distributed version control system, it can be used as a server out of the box. Dedicated Git server software helps, amongst other features, to add access control, display the contents of a Git repository via the web, and help managing multiple repositories.
- *Cloud Solutions* - is a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.

### Next Steps ###

   We would love to hear from you in near future and nothing better than see the results you can come up with.
   Don't give up, you have the right skills and passion, be creative and be open.

   If you don't know how to code, start exploring sites like:
- [Code.org](http://code.org)
- [Aotearoa Code club](https://codeclub.nz/)
- Share what you learn, you will learn much quicker.

### Write a cool 2D game in Javascript ###

Yes, We support the idea of write your next game in Javascript using a more sophisticated library that will make you achieve more goals.

Here's a list of libs we enjoy to work with.

- [http://www.pixijs.com/](http://www.pixijs.com/)
- [https://html5gameengine.com/](https://html5gameengine.com/) Huge list.
